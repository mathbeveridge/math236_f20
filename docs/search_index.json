Decide whether the set of solutions is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space. Briefly justify your answer. \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 5 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) 1.2 Find the Parametric Solution Each of the following matrices is the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.

Give your answers in the form: “scale \\(R_2\\) by 3” or “swap \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_4\\)” or “replace \\(R_3\\) with \\(R_3 + \\frac{1}{5} R_1\\).” \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; 0 &amp; -4 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] \\[A=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\longrightarrow B=\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 6 &amp; -1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\] 1.4 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Use RStudio to find the solution set. Write your answer in parametric form. Your answer to part 2 finds an infinite solution set. In terms of traffic flow, explain why there can be more than one solution. Thinking about cars traveling along streets, why is there some flexibility in the overall flow of cars? Now critique the model as presented. What solutions to the linear system are problematic for our original traffic flow problem? What additional conditions should we require for a valid solution? 1.5 Parabolas Through Two Points You will find the family of all possible parabolas \\[ f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \\] through two given points. Note that there will be an infinite number of such polynomials: there are three unknowns, but only two constraints. So there will be at least one free variable. Here are the plots of the two different families of parabolas that you will consider. For each pair of points, (a) create linear system that represents the problem (b) use RStudio to find the RREF of the augmented matrix for the system and (c) write down the general formula for the family of parabolas \\(f(x)\\) that contain the points. \\(p_1 = (1,0)\\) and \\(p_2 = (5,0)\\) \\(q_1= (1,-3)\\) and \\(q_2 = (5,10)\\) Part 1.1 characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). Let’s refer to this family of parabolas as our “\\(p_1,p_2\\) family.” Pick any two functions \\(g_1(x)\\) and \\(g_2(x)\\) from this \\(p_1,p_2\\) family of parabolas. Now consider the parabola \\[ g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x). \\] Show that \\(g(1)=0\\) and \\(g(5)=0\\). This means that \\(g(x)\\) is also in our \\(p_1,p_2\\) family! (That’s really cool!) Part 1.2 characterizes the family of parabolas that contain the points \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\). Let’s refer to this family of parabolas as our “\\(q_1,q_2\\) family.” Pick any two functions \\(h_1(x)\\) and \\(h_2(x)\\) in this \\(q_1,q_2\\) family. Now consider the parabola \\[ h(x) = h_1(x) - h_2(x). \\] Show that \\(h(1) \\neq -3\\) and \\(h(5) \\neq 10\\). This means that \\(h(x)\\) is NOT in our \\(q_1,q_2\\) family. (So this family is not as nice as the previous one.) Now explain why the parabola \\(h(x)\\) from part 3 is actually a member of the \\(p_1, p_2\\) family. (So maybe this family is nicer than we thought!) Remark: This problem is about families of parabolas. But at its core, this is actually a problem about linear algebra. Obviously, we used linear algebra to solve part 1, but there is linear algebra in the other parts as well! We define \\(g(x) = g_1(x) - g_2(x)\\) by taking a linear combination of two functions. (Just like we take linear combinations of vectors.) What leads to the “nice” behavior of the \\(p_1, p_2\\) family in part 2? It’s because the \\(y\\)-values of the constraining points are both 0. We will soon learn about homogeneous linear systems whose right hand sides are all zero. These homogeneous systems have some very special properties. The \\(q_1, q_2\\) family is “not nice” because it a nonhomogenous system. Just as there is a connection betwen the \\(p_1,p_2\\) family and the \\(q_1, q_2\\) family, we will soon learn that there is a connection between homogeneous systems and nonhomogeneous systems.

Make the appropriate list for each of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). 4.2 Guessing the Inverse Matrix from a Pattern Use RStudio to find the inverse matrix for each of the following matrices. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}. \\] by creating a matrix of the form \\([ \\, A \\, | \\, I \\, ]\\) and putting it into RREF to obtain \\([ \\, I \\, | \\, A^{-1} \\, ]\\). Use the previous part to guess the inverse matrix \\(A^{-1}\\) of the \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp;0&amp;0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp;0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ddots &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Use this same method to guess the inverse matrix \\(B^{-1}\\) for the \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\[ B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ddots &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\\\ n-1 &amp; n-1 &amp; n-1 &amp; n-1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; n-1 &amp; 0 \\\\ n &amp; n &amp; n &amp; n &amp; \\cdots &amp; n &amp; n \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Pro Tip: when R displays a number with a large negative exponent like 3.700743e-17 then this number is \\(3.700743 \\times 10^{-17}\\) which is numerically equivalent to 0. 4.3 LU Decomposition of an Invertible Matrix Let \\(A\\) be a \\(4 \\times 4\\) invertible matrix. Recall that if we run Gaussian Elimination on \\([ \\, A \\, | \\, I \\, ]\\) until the first part is the RREF of matrix \\(A\\), then we get the matrix \\([ \\, I \\, | \\, A^{-1} ]\\). In other words, this procedue is how we calculate \\(A^{-1}\\). But what if we stop this process at the REF of matrix \\(A\\)? Let’s call this resulting matrix \\([ \\, B \\, | \\, C \\, ]\\) where \\(B\\) is the RREF of \\(A\\) where all the pivots are 1, so \\(B\\) looks like \\[ B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; b_{12} &amp; b_{13}&amp; b_{14} \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; b_{23} &amp; b_{24} \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; b_{34} \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] Remark: B is an example of an invertible upper triangular matrix: all the entries below the diagonal are zero. Assume that \\(A\\) is a \\(4 \\times 4\\) matrix such that Gaussian Elimination to REF only uses two types of Elementary Row Operations: (E1) Add a multiple of one row to another (E3) Multiply a row by a nonzero constant. Explain why \\(C\\) has the the form \\[ C = \\begin{bmatrix} c_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ c_{21} &amp; c_{22} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ c_{31} &amp; c_{32} &amp; c_{33} &amp; 0 \\\\ c_{41} &amp; c_{42} &amp; c_{43} &amp; c_{44} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] where the diagonal elements \\(c_{11}, c_{22}, c_{33}, c_{44}\\) are nonzero. Remark: C is an example of an invertible lower triangular matrix: all the entries above the diagonal are zero. Explain why \\(CA=B\\). Next, you will show that the inverse matrix \\(C^{-1}\\) is also lower triangluar. Start with the matrix \\([ \\, C \\, | \\, I \\, ]\\) and perform Gaussian Elimination to put \\(C\\) into RREF to get the matrix \\([ \\, I \\, | \\, C^{-1} ]\\). Considering the lower triangular structure of \\(C\\), explain why putting \\(C\\) into \\(REF\\) actually results in the identity matrix \\(I\\). Use the previous three parts to show that we can factor \\(A=LU\\) where \\(L\\) is an invertible lower triangular matrix and \\(U\\) is an upper triangular matrix. Remark 1: You proved this for a \\(4 \\times 4\\) matrix, but your argument also works for an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. Remark 2: If Gaussian Elimination of \\(A\\) requires row operation (E2) “exchange two rows” then we can choose to do those row swaps first. This corresponds to multiplying \\(A\\) by an invertible permutation matrix \\(P\\). We then perform Gaussian Elimination on \\(PA\\): we can factor \\(PA=LU\\) where \\(L\\) is lower triangular and \\(U\\) is upper triangular. This is called the \\(LU\\)-decomposition of \\(A\\). Remark 3: It turns out that explicitly calculating \\(A^{-1}\\) can lead to some very problematic rounding errors. So most solvers use the \\(LU\\)-decomposition to solve \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{b}\\) instead of calculating \\(\\mathsf{x} = A^{-1}\\mathsf{b}\\). More specifically, we replace \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{b}\\) with \\(LU \\mathsf{x} = P^{-1} \\mathsf{b}\\) and then solve this in two steps. First, we solve \\(L \\mathsf{y} = P^{-1}\\mathsf{b}\\). Because \\(L\\) is lower triangular, this runs exactly like ``back substitution.’’ Next, we solve \\(U \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{y}\\). Because \\(L\\) is upper triangular, this also runs like ``back substitution.’’ Remark 4: So what can go wrong when computing \\(A^{-1}\\)? Sometimes an invertible matrix is ill-conditioned which means that the rounding errors get in the way of the numerical calculation of the inverse. (Basically: you end up dividing by a number really close to 0.) The \\(LU\\) methodology avoids this problem. You can learn more about this in MATH 365 Computational Linear Algebra. 4.4 Homogeneous Coordinates I made the following nature scene with a bird and a palm tree. bird = rbind(c(20, 21.3, 23.3, 21.6, 20.7, 21.7, 20.9, 20.3, 18.9, 18.1, 18.3, 19.6, 19.2, 19.1, 19.2, 19.4, 20), c(20, 21.7, 20.9, 21.1, 19.3, 18.7, 18, 18.9, 18, 15.4, 18.6, 19.6, 20, 20.2, 20.3, 20.3, 20), c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)) fronds = rbind(c(10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 2.5, 4, 6, 9, 10, 10, 9, 7, 5, 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 10.5, 12, 12.5, 12.5, 10, 10, 13, 15, 15.5, 15.5, 14, 12, 10, 10, 12, 14, 14, 13.5, 13, 12, 10), c(16, 16, 16, 15, 11, 15, 17, 17.5, 17, 16, 16, 17.5, 19, 19.5, 18.5, 20, 20.5, 20, 19, 16, 16, 18, 20, 20.5, 20, 19, 18, 16, 16, 17, 16, 15, 13.5, 15, 16, 16, 16, 15, 13, 11, 9, 11, 13, 16), c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)) trunk = rbind(c(10, 9, 8, 7.5, 7.5, 8, 10, 8, 6.5, 6, 5, 5, 6, 7, 10), c(16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 5, 2.5, 2, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16), c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)) # intialize the plot plot(bird[1,],bird[2,],type=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(0,25),ylim=c(0,25),xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;y&quot;) abline(h=0:25, v=0:25, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;) # plot the bird, trunk and fronds polygon(bird[1,], bird[2,], col = &quot;gray&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) polygon(fronds[1,], fronds[2,], col = &quot;orange&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) polygon(trunk[1,], trunk[2,], col = &quot;brown&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) However, I’ve decided that I want to make some changes. I want to rotate the bird by \\(-\\pi/2\\) around the point \\((20,20)\\) where its head meets its wing. I want to enlarge the fronds (leaves) of the plam tree to be bigger by \\(25\\%\\). I like the trunk just as it is (no changes!), so the fronds should still meet at the point \\((10,16)\\). I want to change the colors to make it happier. For example, here is what I want it to look like (though maybe there is a better color choice). However, I’m not sure how to do this because: I only know how to rotate vectors around the point \\((0,0)\\). So how can I rotate around the point \\((20,20)\\)? Likewise, I only know how to expand vectros from the point \\((0,0)\\). So how can I expand outward from the point \\((10,16)\\)? I heard someone say that translations via homogeneous coordinates will help to solve my problem. But I’m not sure what to do. Help! Please submit: The numerical \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix birdmap that you used for the bird, and an explanation of how you made it. The numerical \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix leafmap that you used for the leaves, and an explanation of how you made it. Your resulting plot where you use happier colors of your choice that are unique to you and express your personal style. (An artist statement is optional.) For your convenience, here is some template code for you. Once you fill in the proper transformation, this code will make the final picture. Currently, it updates the colors, but doesn’t change the bird or the fronds (because it is using the identity transformation). ##################### ######## update this code with the appropriate linear transformations birdmap = cbind(c(1,0,0),c(0,1,0),c(0,0,1)) leafmap = cbind(c(1,0,0),c(0,1,0),c(0,0,1)) ##################### ######## you do not need to change this the code below this line newbird = birdmap %*% bird newfronds = leafmap %*% fronds # initialize the plot plot(newbird[1,],newbird[2,],type=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(0,25),ylim=c(0,25),xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;y&quot;) abline(h=0:25, v=0:25, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;) polygon(newbird[1,], newbird[2,], col = &quot;cyan&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) polygon(newfronds[1,], newfronds[2,], col = &quot;green&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) polygon(trunk[1,], trunk[2,], col = &quot;brown&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) Finally, here is some R code that might be helpful. It overlays the original and the new version, so that you can directly compare them. Here is what the final comparison should look like: # initialize the plot plot(newbird[1,],newbird[2,],type=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(0,25),ylim=c(0,25),xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;y&quot;) abline(h=0:25, v=0:25, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;) # plot the new bird and new fronds polygon(newbird[1,], newbird[2,], col = &quot;gray&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) polygon(newfronds[1,], newfronds[2,], col = &quot;orange&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) # plot the original bird, fronds and trunk polygon(bird[1,], bird[2,], col = &quot;cyan&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) polygon(fronds[1,], fronds[2,], col = &quot;green&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) polygon(trunk[1,], trunk[2,], col = &quot;brown&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) Remark: This truly is how computer animation works! We use different effects for each object, and need to use homogeneous coordinates to get our desired results.

Risk Game Board (image: wikipedia) Here is a network representation of the gameboard, created from an adjacency matrix. library(igraph) risk &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20/main/data/riskmatrix.csv&quot;) A = data.matrix(risk) countries = names(risk) g=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A,mode=&#39;undirected&#39;) coords = layout_nicely(g) plot(g, layout=coords, vertex.size = 10, vertex.label.cex=0.75, vertex.color=&#39;khaki&#39;, vertex.frame.color=&quot;black&quot;) Calculate Gould’s Index for this network. Use this Gould’s Index ranking to identify the most central territory in each of the six continents in this worldwide network. Here is a list of territories by continent (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America) to help you to classify the territories. Turn in a table with six rows. These six rows should be ordered by Gould’s index. Each row should contain: name of the continent name of the territory with the largest Gould Index, the degree of the territory, the Gould’s Index value for the territory.

Upload your solutions to Moodle in a PDF. Please feel free to use RStudio for all calculations, including row reduction, matrix multiplication, eigenvector calculation and inverse matrices. You can download the Rmd source file for this problem set. You can download a Rmd template solution file. This problem set covers Sections 5.5 Complex Eigenvalues and 5.6 Dynamical Systems, as well as Modeling of Ecological Systems. Three out of four questions require you to use RStudio. I’ve provided a PS7 solution template if you want to use it. 7.1 Glucose-Insulin System Model Note: Use the functions get_trajectory(A, start, N) and plot_trajectory(X, title, types) from Modeling of Ecological Systems to create trajectories and plots for this question. The excess glucose level \\(G_t\\) and excess insulin level \\(H_t\\) in a digestive system are determined by the update rule \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} G_{t+1} \\\\ H_{t+1} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.998 &amp; -0.169 \\\\ 0.068 &amp; 0.930 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} G_{t} \\\\ H_{t} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a G_t + b H_t \\\\ c G_t + d H_t \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] a. Suppose that we have an intake of glucose \\(\\begin{bmatrix} G_{0} \\\\ H_{0} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\\) Make a plot of this system and that you can use to estimate how long it will take for this system to return (approximately) to homeostatis, where the values stay steady at \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\). Calculate the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda = a \\pm b i\\) for this matrix. Use them to find the decay rate \\(|\\lambda| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) and the rate of rotation \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1} (a/b)\\), measured in degrees. You can find this value in RStudio using the command atan(a/b) * 360 / (2 * pi). 7.2 Population Interaction Models The dynamics of two interacting populations \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) can be modeled using a discrete dynamical system of the form \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} X_{t+1} \\\\ Y_{t+1} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} X_{t} \\\\ Y_{t} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a X_t + b Y_t \\\\ c X_t + d Y_t \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] where \\(a,b,c,d\\) are constants that depend on the type of interaction. The constants have the following interpretations: constant qualitative interpretation quantitative interpretation \\(a\\) Does population \\(X\\) thrive in the absence of population \\(Y\\)? If \\(a &gt; 1\\), then \\(X\\) thrives without \\(Y\\). If \\(0 &lt; a &lt; 1\\) then \\(X\\) dies out without \\(Y\\). b What is the effect of population \\(Y\\) on population \\(X\\)? If \\(b &gt; 0\\) then \\(Y\\) helps \\(X\\) to thrive. If \\(b &lt; 0\\) then \\(Y\\) hinders the population growth of \\(X\\). c What is the effect of population \\(X\\) on population \\(Y\\)? If \\(c &gt; 0\\) then \\(X\\) helps \\(Y\\) to thrive. If \\(c &lt; 0\\) then \\(X\\) hinders the population growth of \\(Y\\). d Does population \\(Y\\) thrive in the absence of population \\(X\\)? If \\(d &gt; 1\\), then \\(Y\\) thrives without \\(X\\). If \\(0 &lt; d &lt; 1\\) then \\(Y\\) dies out without \\(X\\). Let’s consider 3 different types of population interaction. Predation: one population feeds off the other. One example: foxes and rabbits. Competition: the populations compete for the same resources. One example: squirrels and chipmunks. Mutual Symbiosis: the populations play complementary roles. Both thrive or decline together. One example: bees and flowers. You will characterize the constants corresponding to these interactions and then analyze some examples. (Note: these population models are oversimplified, of course. We are interested in seeing how eigenvalues and eigenvectors help to make sense of these systems.) For each of the proposed models (predation, competition, mutual symbiosis), characterize the values for the constants \\(a,b,c,d\\) by using the interpretations listed above. For example, you must decide whether \\(a&gt;1\\) or \\(0 &lt; a &lt; 1\\) for each model. Your answer should be written in table form, as shown below. model a b c d predation competition symbiosis Here are three different population models, along with its eigenvalue and eigenvectors. For each one, you must decide whether it is Predation, Competition or Symbiosis. Your answer will be three simple statements like “\\(M\\) is predation.” \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix}1.1 &amp; -0.2 \\\\ -0.3 &amp; 1.2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad \\lambda_1 = 1.4 \\mbox{ with } \\mathsf{v}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1.5 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad \\lambda_2 = 0.9 \\mbox{ with } \\mathsf{v}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) \\(B = \\begin{bmatrix}0.5 &amp; 0.4 \\\\ -0.2 &amp; 1.1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad \\lambda_1 = 0.9 \\mbox{ with } \\mathsf{v}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad \\lambda_2 = 0.7 \\mbox{ with } \\mathsf{v}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}\\) \\(C = \\begin{bmatrix}0.8 &amp; 0.3 \\\\ 0.4 &amp; 0.7 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad \\lambda_1 = 1.1 \\mbox{ with } \\mathsf{v}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad \\lambda_2 = 0.4 \\mbox{ with } \\mathsf{v}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -0.75 \\end{bmatrix}\\) Here are plots of the vector fields for the three models in part (b). Match the model \\(A, B, C\\) to its corresponding vector field. Your answer will be three simple statements like “\\(M\\) is Vector Field 2.” Vector Field 1 Vector Field 2 Vector Field 3 For each matrix model \\(A,B,C\\), assume that the initial population is \\([X_0, Y_0]^{\\top} = [1, 2.5]^{\\top}\\) where the units are in millions of organisms. Use the corresponding vector field to visualize the trajetory starting at \\([1, 2.5]^{\\top}\\). Describe the trajectory in words. (For example: “At first both populations decrease to \\([0.5, 1]^{\\top}\\). But then they both start increasing and converge to the direction of \\([2,3]^{\\top}\\). They continue to grow forever.” ) Indicate the long-term populations for both organisms (growth, stable, extinction). Connect the behavior you see back to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the model 7.3 Blue Whale Population Dynamics Note: Use the functions get_trajectory(A, start, N) and plot_trajectory(X, title, types) from Modeling of Ecological Systems to create trajectories and plots for this question. In the 1930’s (before its virtual extinction and a great change in its survival rates), a researcher studied the blue whale population. Due to the long gestation period, mating habits and migration of the blue whale, a female can produce a calf only once in a two-year period. Thus the age classes for the whale were assumed to be: 0-1 years 2-3 years 4-5 years 6-7 years 8-9 years 10-11 years 12 or more years The Leslie Matrix \\(B\\) for this model is given by (L=rbind(c(0,0,.19,.44,.5,.5,.45), c(.77,0,0,0,0,0,0), c(0,.77,0,0,0,0,0), c(0,0,.77,0,0,0,0), c(0,0,0,.77,0,0,0), c(0,0,0,0,.77,0,0), c(0,0,0,0,0,.77,.78))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] ## [1,] 0.00 0.00 0.19 0.44 0.50 0.50 0.45 ## [2,] 0.77 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 ## [3,] 0.00 0.77 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 ## [4,] 0.00 0.00 0.77 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 ## [5,] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.77 0.00 0.00 0.00 ## [6,] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.77 0.00 0.00 ## [7,] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.77 0.78 We can see that the vector of fecundities is \\([0,0,0.19,0.44,0.5,0.5,0.45]\\), and that the survival rate for all whales 11 years old or younger is 77%, and for all whales 12 or more years, it is 78%. Starting from a whale population of 1000 in each of the seven age classes, plot the trajectories over a 40 year period. Does your plot of this model predict population growth, population equilibrium or population extinction? Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix \\(L\\). Relate the behavior you see to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. What is the overall growth rate? What are the long-term population ratios? When population is increasing, one might be interested in harvesting a portion of the population for some purpose. We want this harvest rate to be sustainable, meaning that the total population remains at a constant level in the long run. For simplicity, we will not distinguish between classes during the harvest (but this could be added with a minor modification). If a fraction \\(h\\) of the population is harvested each year, where \\(0 &lt; h &lt; 1\\), then the population model becomes \\[{\\bf x}_{t+1} = (1-h) L {\\bf x}_t.\\] Use trial and error to find the sustainable harvest rate \\(h &lt; 1\\) up to 4 decimal places that leads to a stable population of whales. Then plot a trajectory of this system with sustainable harvesting. Choose a long enough time peroid so that your plot shows that the blue whale populations reach a very stable configuration. In the long run, what are the percentages of whales in each age class? How does this compare to the population percentages you found in part (b)? Why does this make sense? 7.4 The Power Method for Eigenvalue Calculation During class, we found eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A−\\lambda I) =0\\). We then found the eigenvectors by finding a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A - \\lambda I)\\). This is fine for small matrices, but impractical for large ones. So let’s see how computers find (or really: approximate) eigensystems. We will assume that all of the eigenvectors of \\(A\\) are real and distinct. If you want the full story, then you should take MATH 365 Computational Linear Algebra. This problem explains how the Power Method and Inverse Power Methods work. At certain points, Your Task is identified, and that is what you must turn in for this problem. Parts (a) and (c) will have you confirm that the code below works for the following \\(4 \\times 4\\) matrix \\(A\\). We calculate its eigensystems up front so that you can compare your approximations to the values found by R.

This problem is not supposed to be hard. If you crave more guidance or background while working on this problem, then you can compare to ULA Section 5.2 and Lay Section 5.8. The Power Method. We find the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector by repeatedly multiplying some initial vector by \\(A\\) until we converge to the dominant eigenspace. This should sound familiar: it’s the same phenomenon that makes our dynamical systems converge! The one extra detail is that we rescale at each step: we adjust our eigenvector estimate so that its largest entry is 1. Here is the code. It is very simple. estimate_dominant_eigenvector &lt;- function(A, numiter) { n = dim(A)[1] x = rep(1,n) for (i in 1:numiter) { y = A %*% x maxval = max(y) minval = min(y) if (abs(maxval) &gt; abs(minval)) { m = maxval } else { m = minval } x = y/m } est = &#39;estimate&#39; attr(est,&#39;value&#39;) = m attr(est, &#39;vector&#39;) = x return(est) } Your Task: Run this code on the matrix \\(A\\) and start with numiter=5. Then increase this value and watch the eigenvalue estimate converge to the dominant eigenvalue. What is the smallest number of iterations needed so that the estimated eigenvalue matches the eigenvalue returned by eigen(A) (up to 5 decimal places)? Write some code to compare the estimated eigenvector (whose largest entry is 1) with the eigenvector returned by eigen(A). They should match when you rescale. The Inverse Power Method Explained. We can use the power method to find the other eigenvalues, too. Let’s suppose that we are trying to find eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) with eigenvector \\(\\mathsf{v}\\). We just need to start at a guess \\(c\\) that is closer to \\(\\lambda\\) that to any of the other eigenvalue. In other words, if \\(\\mu\\) is any other eigenvale of \\(A\\), we have \\(| \\lambda - c| &lt; | \\mu - c|.\\) Using our guess \\(c\\), we define \\[ B = (A - c I)^{-1}. \\] And then we apply the power method to \\(B\\). You will now show that (1) \\(A-cI\\) really is invertible, and that (2) \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is the dominant eigenvector of \\(B\\). Your Task: answer the following four short questions. Each answer only requires a sentence or two. Suppose that \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) for eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\). That is, \\(A \\mathsf{v} = \\lambda \\mathsf{v}\\). Confirm that \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is an eigenvector for \\(A - cI\\) for eigenvalue \\(\\lambda - c\\). Assume that our guess \\(c\\) is not an eigenvalue of \\(A\\). Prove that \\(A-cI\\) is invertible by showing that \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A-Ic) = \\mathbf{0}\\). Now that we know that \\(B = (A - c I)^{-1}\\) exists, explain why \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(B\\) for eigenvalue \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda-c}.\\) A similar argument shows that all eigenvalues of \\(B\\) are of the form \\(\\frac{1}{\\mu-c}\\) where \\(\\mu\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A\\). So now use the fact that “\\(c\\) that is closer to \\(\\lambda\\) that to any of the other eigenvalue” to explain why \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda-c}\\) is the dominant eigenvalue of \\(B\\). The Inverse Power Method in Practice. In part (b), you showed why the inverse power method works! Now, here is the code, which is very simple. (Remark: in order to avoid rounding errors, in a true implementation, we would write code that avoids explicitly taking the inverse.) estimate_nearest_eigenvector &lt;- function(A, c, numiter) { n = dim(A)[1] B = A - c * diag(n) Binv = solve(B) est = estimate_dominant_eigenvector(Binv, numiter) val = attr(est, &#39;value&#39;) newval = 1/val+c attr(est,&#39;value&#39;) = newval return (est) } Your Task: Use this code to confirm that we can really find the other three eigenvalues for matrix \\(A\\) above. Run this code using a guess for each of the 3 remaining eigenvalues. Confirm that this code does find the correct eigenvalue, provided that you run for enough iterations. Note what your initial guess is, and how many iterations are required to converge to the nearest eigenvalue (up to 5 decimal places). Remark: These two methods succeed in finding the complete eigensystem when all of the eigenvalues are real and distinct. This is one of the reasons why the eigen() command in RStudio actually uses another method called \\(QR\\)-decomposition to approximate eigensystems. Remark: MATH 365 Computational Linear Algebra goes into the full story about how to approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors quickly and precisely.

Download this Rmd file. First, we will create vectors and matrices Then we will see how to create an augmented matrix and then apply Gaussian Elimination to obtain is reduced row echelon form. Gaussian elimination is performed by the rref() command. However, this command is not loaded into R by default. So we have have to tell RStudio to use the practical math package, which is known as pracma. So we need to run the following command once at the beginning of our session. 14.1 Building Vectors and Matrices A vector in R is a list of data. The simplest way to create a vector is to use the c() command. The letter ‘c’ is short for ‘combine these values into a vector.’ For example, we can make a vector v for the numbers 1,2,3 as follows: ## [1] 1 2 3 Note that we had to ask R to display the value of v. This is because the assignment of v doesn’t echo the value to the console. But can see the value of v in the Environment tab in the upper right panel of RStudio. For example, run this command and then check to see that the value of v gets updated in the environment. It is interesting to note that c() returns a dimensionless vector. So you can treat a vector c() as either a row or a column when you construct a matrix. For example, suppose that we want to make the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We could create this matrix by binding three row vectors: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 or we could bind three column vectors: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 14.2 Solving a Linear System Suppose that we want to solve the linear system \\[\\begin{aligned} x + y + z &amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x + 4y + 8z &amp;= 6 \\\\ 3x +9y+27z &amp;=12 \\end{aligned}\\] which has coefficient matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] and target (column) vector \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This is the same matrix A we defined above. Let’s define a vector b and use cbind() to create an augmented matrix which we will name Ab. (We could have just made the full augmented matrix from the start, but using cbind to add a column to a matrix is a skill we will use later in the course!) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 ## b ## [1,] 1 1 1 4 ## [2,] 2 4 8 6 ## [3,] 3 9 27 12 Now we use the rref() command to apply Gaussian Elimination to produce the reduced row echelon form. (And remember: we had to load this function into R by using the require(pracma) command above.) ## b ## [1,] 1 0 0 7 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 We conclude that this is a consistent system no free variables. The unique solution is \\[\\begin{align} x&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=-4\\\\ z&amp;=1 \\end{align}\\] We can verify that our answer works by multiplying \\(A\\) by one of the solutions above. Matrix multiplication uses the funny operation %*%. ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 12 Which matches our target \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\] just as we had hoped. 14.3 Solving another Linear System Now let’s find the solution set for the linear system \\[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\\\ -x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +x_3 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 10 \\\\ x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] which corresponds to augmented matrix \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 2 &amp; +1 &amp; +2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 10 \\\\ 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This time, let’s just construct the augmented matrix direclty. Then we define the coefficient matrix \\(A\\). Here we use cbind to combine the vectors into the columns of a matrix named \\(A\\). You can use rbind if you want to combine the vectors into the rows of a matrix. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 ## [2,] 2 1 2 1 5 10 ## [3,] -1 1 1 0 0 4 ## [4,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 And now let’s row reduce to get RREF. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -1 -1 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 2 3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 So the set of solutions in parametric form is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + s \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and this is a “plane” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). It is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) because these vectors have 5 coordinates. It is a plane because it is spanned by two vectors that are not on the same line. 14.4 Appendix: Dimensionless Vectors in R Let’s revisit the vector constructed by cbind. Above we called this a “dimensionless” vector because it can be used as a column vector or a row vector. In general, R will do its best to make sense of a dimensionless vector. In other words, it will promote c() to make an expression valid. For example, let \\(A\\) be an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, and let \\(b\\) be a vector. The expression \\(Av\\) is only defined when \\(v\\) is a \\(n \\times 1\\) column vector and that \\(wA\\) is only defined when \\(w\\) is a \\(1 \\times n\\) ** row vector**. But let’s look at what happens when we use a dimensionless vector instead. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 -1 0 ## [2,] 1 0 1 ## [3,] 1 1 -1 ## [1] 2 5 11 ## [,1] ## [1,] -3 ## [2,] 13 ## [3,] -4 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 18 9 -6 Both of these multiplications worked! So R treated b as a column vector for the multiplicationA %*% b. And then R treated b as a row vector for the multiplication b %b% A. So how do you make a true column vector or a true row vector? The answer is to use cbind and rbind! Here are some examples: ## [1] 1 2 3 4 ## b ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 ## [4,] 4 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## b 1 2 3 4 "],["d-linear-transformations.html", "Vector 15 2D Linear Transformations 15.1 Functions to plot our vectors 15.2 Your Turn 15.3 Exploration 15.4 Even More Exploration", " Vector 15 2D Linear Transformations Let’s explore linear transformations of the plane! Download this Rmd file. We know that a linear transformation \\(T\\) satisfies \\[ T(c \\mathsf{u} + d \\mathsf{v}) = c\\, T( \\mathsf{u}) +d \\, T( \\mathsf{v}). \\] But what do linear transformations look like? Let’s start to answer this question by considering linear transformations of the plane. We will look at mappings \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\) where \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = \\mathsf{A} \\mathsf{x}\\) for a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix \\(\\mathsf{A}\\). \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}. \\] The linear transformation \\(T(\\mathsf{x})\\) maps the plane to itself. This nicely allows us to compare vectors before the mapping with their images after the mapping. We can then describe the effect of the mapping on the plane. 15.1 Functions to plot our vectors Here are a couple of helper functions to plot our “before” and “after” vectors as arrows in the plane. This function has four parameters. The parameters before1 and before2 are two vectors before the mapping, and after1 and after2 are their images after the mapping. The function creates a dashed plot of the parallelogram with corners (0,0), before1, before2 and before1+before2. It also creates a solid plot of the image of this parallelogram. These are plotted on the same plane so taht we can easily compare “before” and “after.” Here is an example. Let’s start with vectors \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\). It’s nice to start with vectors of different lengths. Let’s consider the mapping correspoding to multiplication by the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Here is some example code showing how to make our plot. Note: A %*% x is the syntax for matrix multiplication in R. Figure 15.1: An example 2D linear transformation This visualization uses different colors for the vectors so that you can match up the original vector with its image. There is a lot going on in this mapping, so let’s start making some observations. The original rectangle mapped to a parallelogram. So the shape is ``squished’’ a bit. Both the black vector and the red vector have gotten larger. But we can see that the red vector has grown much more than the black one. So there is expansion, but it is not uniform. The black vector and the red vector have flipped! This means that there is some sort of reflection happening. There isn’t a simple description for what’s happening here. It’s a combination of effects, so that the image of the rectangle is a warped version of the original. 15.2 Your Turn Now it’s your turn. Investigate the effect of each of the following families of mappings. Using the previous code snippet as a guide, create a “before and after plot” for the black vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\) and the red vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\) Describe the effect of the mapping as best you can. Be sure to look at the different effect on the black vector and the red vector. Use words like, expansion, contraction, rotation, reflection and shear. Once you have looked at the effect of the family, look back at the form of the matrix \\(A\\). Can you explain why it leads to the outcome you see? 15.2.1 Family 1 Explore matrices of the form \\[A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; b \\end{bmatrix}}.\\] Once again, try various combinations of positive, negative, small and large numbers.

You should treat this tiny number as equal to 0.

For each one, try to make other matrices that have a similar effect. (What is the relationship between the entries that leads to this particular kind of image?) \\[ A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -3 \\\\ 2 &amp; -6 \\end{bmatrix}}, \\qquad B=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}}, \\qquad C=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}}, \\qquad D=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 0 \\\\ 3 &amp; 2 \\end{bmatrix}}, \\qquad \\] 15.3 Exploration Now it’s time to explore. Try one or more of the following: Can you find a mapping that will turn the rectangle with corners (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), (0,2) into a square? Look at some different starting vectors. Try some other matrices. What is the relationship between the rank of the matrix and the image of the transformation? 15.4 Even More Exploration For a more interactive experinece, head over to Section 2.6.2 of Understanding Linear Algbra.

What happens when \\(a\\) is negative? when \\(b\\) is negative? when both are negative? 16.3 Reflection over the line \\(y=x\\) Now let’s try reflecting the house over the line \\(y = x\\).

Then consider a wider variety of such matrices as with the families above. 16.5 Dimension Reduction Here we perform the transformation that sends \\(\\mathsf{e}_1\\) to \\((-1,1/2)\\) and \\(\\mathsf{e}_2\\) to \\((2,-1)\\). Notice that they are the same line and the transformation projects the house onto this line. (A = cbind(c(-1,1/2),c(2,-1))) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] -1.0 2 ## [2,] 0.5 -1 plot(house[1,],house[2,],type=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(-5,5),xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;y&quot;) abline(h=-6:6, v=-6:6, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;) house2 = A %*% house polygon(house[1,], house[2,], col = &quot;gray&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) polygon(house2[1,], house2[2,], col = &quot;pink&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) 16.5.1 Your Turn Explore matrices of the form \\[ A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; ca \\\\ b &amp; cb \\end{bmatrix}} \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ ca &amp; cb \\end{bmatrix}} \\] Once again, consider a wide variety of such matrices using various values for \\(a,b,c\\). 16.6 A Complicated Transformation Finally, suppose that we wish to perform the transformation that reflects over the \\(y\\)-axis, then rotates by pi/2, and finally scales the \\(x\\)-direction by 2 and the y-direction by 3 in that order. You can do this as three matrices that you multiply together. Note: The order of these matrices goes from right to left. The rightmost matrix is the one that is closest to the vector. So that transformation happens first! The matrix A: scale = cbind(c(2,0),c(0,3)) rot = cbind(c(cos(pi/2),sin(pi/2)),c(-sin(pi/2),cos(pi/2))) reflect = cbind(c(-1,0),c(0,1)) A = scale %*% rot %*% reflect plot(house[1,],house[2,],type=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(-5,5),xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;y&quot;) abline(h=-6:6, v=-6:6, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;) house2 = A %*% house polygon(house[1,], house[2,], col = &quot;gray&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) polygon(house2[1,], house2[2,], col = &quot;pink&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) 16.6.1 Your Turn Using the previous example as a guide, create a complicated mapping of your own that combines some of the linear transformations above. "],["d-translations-with-homogeneous-coordinates.html", "Vector 17 2D Translations with Homogeneous Coordinates 17.1 Translation 17.2 Translation and then Rotation 17.3 Rotation and then Translation 17.4 Your Turn", " Vector 17 2D Translations with Homogeneous Coordinates Download this Rmd file A translation of the plane shifts every vector by a constant vector. For example, the mapping \\[ S \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ -4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} x +3 \\\\ y - 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\] translates every vector in the plane by \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ -4~ \\end{bmatrix}\\). The bad news: This is a simple and natural mapping, but it is not a linear transformation! We know that a linear transformation must map \\(\\mathbb{0}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{0}\\), and that is certainly not the case when we translate! This restriction is rather limiting for computer graphics: we can never move our image away from the origin. The good news: We can work around this problem by creating a 3D linear transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\) and then retricting our attention to a plane in this larger space. As discussed in the Homogeneous Coordinates video, we do the following: Embed the \\(xy\\)-plane \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) into the plane \\(z = 1\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). Translate in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) using a mapping \\(T\\) that maps this horizontal plane to itself. That is: \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ v \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] When we create our plot, we use only the first two coordinates and ignore the third coordinate (which is still 1). In summary, during our calculations, we replace the vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) with the homogeneous coordinate vector \\(\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). 17.1 Translation Here is my house once again. Note that we have add \\(z=1\\) as the third coordinate to each point. However, when plotting, we only use the first two coordinates. # the third entry always = 1 house = cbind(c(0,0,1), c(0,3/4,1), c(1/2,3/4,1), c(1/2,0,1), c(1,0,1), c(1,1,1), c(5/4,1,1), c(0,2,1), c(-5/4,1,1), c(-1,1,1), c(-1,0,1), c(0,0,1)); # only plot the first two coordinates plot(house[1,],house[2,],type=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(-6,6),ylim=c(-6,6),xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;y&quot;) abline(h=-6:6, v=-6:6, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;) polygon(house[1,], house[2,], col = &quot;gray&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) Next, we translate by \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ - 4 \\end{bmatrix}\\) by using the linear transformation \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Let’s check that this has the desired effect on a homogeneous coordinate vector: \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} x+3 \\\\ y - 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] It worked! Note that this linear transformation maps every horizontal plane to itself. For the plane \\(z=1\\) (and only for this plane!) we get the exact translation that we desire. So it is crucial that \\(z=1\\). That’s the magic of homogeneous coordinates. Let’s do this calculation in R and plot the first two coordiantes: A = cbind(c(1,0,0),c(0,1,0),c(3,-4,1)) house2 = A %*% house # only plot the first two coordinates plot(house[1,],house[2,],type=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(-6,6),ylim=c(-6,6),xlab=&quot;x&quot;,ylab=&quot;y&quot;) abline(h=-6:6, v=-6:6, col=&quot;gray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;) polygon(house[1,], house[2,], col = &quot;gray&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) polygon(house2[1,], house2[2,], col = &quot;pink&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;) 17.2 Translation and then Rotation We know plenty 2D linear transformation, including rotation, reflection and shear mappings. We can turn any of them into a 3D transformation by appending a row and a column with a 1 in the lower right corner and zero everywhere else. For example, the 2D rotation \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos \\theta &amp; -\\sin \\theta~ \\\\ \\sin \\theta &amp; \\cos \\theta \\end{bmatrix} \\] becomes the 3D transformation \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta &amp; -\\sin\\theta~ &amp; 0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta &amp; \\cos\\theta &amp;0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This mapping rotates 3D space around the \\(z\\)-axis. So let’s combine two operations: a translation and a rotation. First, let’s translate by \\(\\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) and then rotate counterclockwise by \\(2 \\pi/3\\). And remember: the matrix closest to the vector acts first. So if we want to translate first, the translation matrix needs to be to the right of the rotation matrix: \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos \\frac{2\\pi}{3} &amp; -\\sin\\frac{2\\pi}{3}~ &amp; 0 \\\\ \\sin\\frac{2\\pi}{3} &amp; \\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{3} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}. \\] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 -2 ## [2,] 0 1 1 ## [3,] 0 0 1 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.5000000 -0.8660254 0 ## [2,] 0.8660254 -0.5000000 0 ## [3,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 1 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.5000000 -0.8660254 0.1339746 ## [2,] 0.8660254 -0.5000000 -2.2320508 ## [3,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 1.0000000 17.3 Rotation and then Translation Let’s reverse the order of these matrices and see that we get a different transformation. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.5000000 -0.8660254 -2 ## [2,] 0.8660254 -0.5000000 1 ## [3,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 1 Indeed, these two transformations are different! So the order matters. 17.4 Your Turn Here are a couple of plots that you should try to reproduce using homogeneous coordinates. 17.4.1 House of Orange Here is a picture of a gray house and a larger, upside-down orange house. Work as a group to reproduce this image using homogeneous coordinates. You will have to use a combination of translation, rotation, and expansion. You will do this by multiplying three matrices. Think carefully and experiment.

Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues and compare them to your plot. The eigensystem should tell the same story as your plot. If your original plot is confusing, try changing the parameters (initial square size, plot size, number of grid points). Here is some code for you to adapt for the examples. &#39;```{r, echo=TRUE} A = cbind(c(1,0),c(0,1)) trajectory_plot(A, t=30, datamax=5, plotmax=10, numpoints=10) eigen(A) 19.3.1 Example 1 \\[ A = \\frac{1}{60} \\begin{bmatrix} 55&amp; -8 \\\\ -1 &amp; 53 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 19.3.2 Example 2 \\[ A = \\frac{1}{20} \\begin{bmatrix} 24&amp; -6 \\\\ 1 &amp; 19 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 19.3.3 Example 3 \\[ A = \\frac{1}{110} \\begin{bmatrix} 106&amp; 12 \\\\ 6 &amp; 92 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 19.3.4 Example 4 \\[ A = \\frac{1}{16} \\begin{bmatrix} 17&amp; -15 \\\\ 15 &amp; 17 \\end{bmatrix} \\] "],["network-centralities.html", "Vector 20 Network Centralities 20.1 Graphs and Networks 20.2 Degree Centrality 20.3 Gould’s Index 20.4 Your Turn: The Rise of Moscow", " Vector 20 Network Centralities Download this Rmd file In this example, we will use a package called igraph.

Here are some places to look for documentation if you want to learn about other features. Let me know if you find any other good references: http://kateto.net/netscix2016 http://igraph.org/r/doc/aaa-igraph- 20.1 Graphs and Networks Graphs consists of vertices and the edges between them. These edges are used to model connections in a wide array of applications, including but not limited to, physical, biological, social, and information networks. To emphasize the application to real-world systems, the term Network Science is sometimes used. So we will use the terms graph and network interchangeably. In this application question, we will see that linear algebra is an important tool in the study of graphs. 20.1.1 Adjacency Matrices Matrices are used to represent graphs and networks in a very direct way: we place a 1 in position \\((i,j)\\) of the adjacency matrix \\(A\\) of the graph \\(G\\), if there is an edge from vertex \\(i\\) to vertex \\(j\\) in \\(G\\). Here is the adjacency matrix we will use today. As you can see it is a \\(12 \\times 12\\) matrix. A = rbind( c(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0), c(1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0), c(0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0), c(1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0), c(0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1), c(0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0), c(0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0), c(0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0), c(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0), c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0), c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0), c(0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] ## [1,] 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## [2,] 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [4,] 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## [5,] 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 ## [6,] 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## [7,] 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## [8,] 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 ## [9,] 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [10,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## [11,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## [12,] 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 dim(A) ## [1] 12 12 Here is how to make the graph from your adjacency matrix g=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A,mode=&#39;undirected&#39;) plot(g, vertex.color=&#39;tan1&#39;, vertex.frame.color=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;) Observe that there is an edge from vertex \\(i\\) to vertex \\(j\\) if and only if there is a 1 in position \\((i,j)\\) in the matrix. Let’s assume that this network is the route map of a small airline. Let’s add vertex labels and change the vertex size: airports = c(&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;LAX&quot;,&quot;ORD&quot;,&quot;MSP&quot;,&quot;DEN&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;SEA&quot;,&quot;PHL&quot;,&quot;PDX&quot;,&quot;MDW&quot;,&quot;LGA&quot;) V(g)$label = airports plot(g,vertex.size=30, vertex.color=&#39;tan1&#39;, vertex.frame.color=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;) 20.1.2 Graph Layouts There are a variety of graph layout algorithms which place the vertices in the plane. You can find many algorithms in the igraph documentation. For example, here is a layout on a circle coords = layout_in_circle(g) plot(g, layout=coords, vertex.size = 30,vertex.label.cex=0.65, vertex.color=&#39;tan1&#39;, vertex.frame.color=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;) The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm is one of the most popular graph vertex layout algorithms. It is a force-directed layout that tries to get a nice-looking graph where edges are similar in length and cross each other as little as possible. The algorithm simulates the graph as a physical system. Vertices are electrically charged particles that repulse each other when they get too close. The edges act as springs that attract connected vertices closer together. As a result, vertices are evenly distributed through the chart area. The resulting layout is intuitive: vertices which share more connections are closer to each other. coords = layout_with_fr(g) plot(g, layout=coords, vertex.size = 30, vertex.label.cex=0.65, vertex.color=&#39;tan1&#39;, vertex.frame.color=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;) We can also choose to layout vertices by hand: locations = rbind( c(20,0),c(-10,0),c(11,7),c(10,15),c(3,12),c(25,10), c(-10,10),c(-12,15),c(20,6),c(-15,12),c(12,4),c(25,13) ) plot(g,vertex.size=20, layout=locations, vertex.label.cex=0.65, vertex.color=&#39;tan1&#39;, vertex.frame.color=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;) 20.2 Degree Centrality If we are considering placing an office in one of our airport locations, we may want to chose the most central hub for that office. It turns out that there are many interesting centrality measures for networks. We will talk about two of them today. The simplest measure centrality is the degree of the vertex, or the number of edges connected to that vertex. We calculate the degree centralities from the adjacency matrix as follows: First make a vector \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) of all 1’s; then multiply \\(\\mathsf{d} = A\\mathsf{v}\\) to get the degree proportions; and we also divide vector \\(\\mathsf{d}\\) by the sum of its entries. The result is a normalized vector \\(\\mathsf{u}\\) whose entries sum to 1. Each entry of vector \\(\\mathsf{u}\\) represents to proportion of edges incident with the corresponding vertex. v=rep(1,nrow(A)) # all 1s vector d = A %*% v # degrees u=d/sum(d) # proportion of degrees cbind(d,u) # show d and u together side-by-side in a matrix ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 3 0.08823529 ## [2,] 5 0.14705882 ## [3,] 2 0.05882353 ## [4,] 4 0.11764706 ## [5,] 5 0.14705882 ## [6,] 2 0.05882353 ## [7,] 4 0.11764706 ## [8,] 5 0.14705882 ## [9,] 1 0.02941176 ## [10,] 1 0.02941176 ## [11,] 1 0.02941176 ## [12,] 1 0.02941176 Now let’s create a data visualization. We plot the network and size each vertex according to the vector \\(u\\). The larger vertices have more edges connected to them. This conveys information to the viewer about the relative importance of the vertices. plot(g, layout=locations, vertex.size=250*u,vertex.label.cex=0.65, vertex.color=&#39;tan1&#39;, vertex.frame.color=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;) We can also sort the vertices by degree. To include the vertex names, we do it in a data frame. df = data.frame(d) # Convert vector to a data frame so that we can add row names rownames(df)=airports ii=order(d,decreasing=TRUE) df2 = data.frame(df[ii,]) rownames(df2) = airports[ii] df2 ## df.ii... ## LAX 5 ## DEN 5 ## SEA 5 ## MSP 4 ## SFO 4 ## ATL 3 ## ORD 2 ## JFK 2 ## PHL 1 ## PDX 1 ## MDW 1 ## LGA 1 20.3 Gould’s Index Gould’s Index is a measure of centrality that uses the dominant eigenvector of a matrix. It was introduced by geographer P. R. Gould in 1967 to analyze the geographical features on maps. We will build up Gould’s Index step-by-step so that we can understand what it measures. 20.3.1 Step 1 The first step is typically to add the identity matrix to the adjancency matrix \\(A\\) to get a new matrix \\[B = A + I.\\] The \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix in R is obtained by using diag(n). Adding the identity gives a connection from a vertex to itself. This loop edge corresponds to staying at the current city during a layover. (B = A + diag(nrow(A))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] ## [1,] 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## [2,] 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [4,] 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## [5,] 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 ## [6,] 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## [7,] 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 ## [8,] 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 ## [9,] 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## [10,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ## [11,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 ## [12,] 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Here is what the corresponding network (with layovers) looks like. You can see why we refer to these additional edges as “loops.” However, we usually do not draw the network with these added loops to keep the figure less cluttered. g2=graph_from_adjacency_matrix(B,mode=&#39;undirected&#39;) airports = c(&quot;ATL&quot;,&quot;LAX&quot;,&quot;ORD&quot;,&quot;MSP&quot;,&quot;DEN&quot;,&quot;JFK&quot;,&quot;SFO&quot;,&quot;SEA&quot;,&quot;PHL&quot;,&quot;PDX&quot;,&quot;MDW&quot;,&quot;LGA&quot;) V(g2)$label = airports coords = layout_with_fr(g2) plot(g2, layout=coords, vertex.color=&#39;tan1&#39;, vertex.frame.color=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;) 20.3.2 Step 2 Start with the all 1’s vector \\(\\mathsf{v}_0 = [1, 1, \\ldots ,1 ]^{\\top}\\). We iterate the mapping \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = B\\mathsf{x}\\) for a few steps to get \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 = B \\mathsf{v}_0\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_2 = B \\mathsf{v}_1 = B^2 \\mathsf{v}_0\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_3 = B \\mathsf{v}_2 = B^3 \\mathsf{v}_0\\). v0 = rep(1,nrow(B)) v1 = B %*% v0 v2 = B %*% v1 v3 = B %*% v2 df = data.frame(cbind(v0,v1,v2,v3)) #Convert vector to a data frame in order to add row names rownames(df)=airports colnames(df)=c(0,1,2,3) df ## 0 1 2 3 ## ATL 1 4 17 76 ## LAX 1 6 29 139 ## ORD 1 3 15 72 ## MSP 1 5 24 109 ## DEN 1 6 28 132 ## JFK 1 3 13 63 ## SFO 1 5 26 122 ## SEA 1 6 26 120 ## PHL 1 2 6 23 ## PDX 1 2 8 34 ## MDW 1 2 8 34 ## LGA 1 2 8 36 20.3.2.1 Your Turn Discuss with your group: Each of the entries of vector \\(\\mathsf{v}_{t}\\) corresponds to “a trip of length \\(t\\).” What kinds of trips does the \\(i\\)th entry of \\(\\mathsf{v}_{t}\\) count? Here is how you can figure this out: Compare the table of vectors with the picture of the network with layovers. Start by looking at the \\(t=1\\) column. The \\(i\\)th entry has something to do with the \\(i\\)th city. Next, look at the \\(t=2\\) column. And so on. Once you have noticed the connection between the network and data, explain why the rule \\(\\mathsf{v}_t = A \\mathsf{v}_{t-1}\\) leads to this result. 20.3.3 Step 3 We can calculate \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_{10}\\) using a loop: N = 10 X = matrix(0,nrow=nrow(B),ncol=N+1) X[,1] = rep(1,nrow(B)) for (i in 2:(N+1)) { X[,i] = B %*% X[,i-1] } X ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] ## [1,] 1 4 17 76 347 1603 7442 34638 161411 752642 3510616 ## [2,] 1 6 29 139 650 3044 14211 66352 309652 1445058 6743119 ## [3,] 1 3 15 72 343 1614 7567 35389 165336 771972 3603377 ## [4,] 1 5 24 109 507 2349 10936 50930 237450 1107376 5165837 ## [5,] 1 6 28 132 621 2909 13611 63595 296984 1386347 6470458 ## [6,] 1 3 13 63 294 1377 6418 29939 139617 651292 3038392 ## [7,] 1 5 26 122 576 2692 12585 58748 274225 1279724 5971890 ## [8,] 1 6 26 120 551 2563 11923 55591 259246 1209469 5642972 ## [9,] 1 2 6 23 99 446 2049 9491 44129 205540 958182 ## [10,] 1 2 8 34 154 705 3268 15191 70782 330028 1539497 ## [11,] 1 2 8 34 154 705 3268 15191 70782 330028 1539497 ## [12,] 1 2 8 36 168 789 3698 17309 80904 377888 1764235 df = data.frame(X) rownames(df)=airports colnames(df)=c(0:10) df ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## ATL 1 4 17 76 347 1603 7442 34638 161411 752642 3510616 ## LAX 1 6 29 139 650 3044 14211 66352 309652 1445058 6743119 ## ORD 1 3 15 72 343 1614 7567 35389 165336 771972 3603377 ## MSP 1 5 24 109 507 2349 10936 50930 237450 1107376 5165837 ## DEN 1 6 28 132 621 2909 13611 63595 296984 1386347 6470458 ## JFK 1 3 13 63 294 1377 6418 29939 139617 651292 3038392 ## SFO 1 5 26 122 576 2692 12585 58748 274225 1279724 5971890 ## SEA 1 6 26 120 551 2563 11923 55591 259246 1209469 5642972 ## PHL 1 2 6 23 99 446 2049 9491 44129 205540 958182 ## PDX 1 2 8 34 154 705 3268 15191 70782 330028 1539497 ## MDW 1 2 8 34 154 705 3268 15191 70782 330028 1539497 ## LGA 1 2 8 36 168 789 3698 17309 80904 377888 1764235 Wow, these numbers get big fast!

Interpret the vector for \\(t=10\\). Since we have normalized our vector, each entry is a proportion, rather than a raw count. Look at the entries as \\(t\\) increases. What do you observe? Iterative multiplication \\(\\mathsf{v}_t = A \\mathsf{v}_{t-1}\\) is a dynamical system! We talked about dynamical systems last week. There is a relationship between the eigenvectors of \\(A\\) and the “long term behavior” of the dynamical system. Share what you remember about this topic with your group. 20.3.4 Step 4 You have observed that the vectors are converging to a common direction. We get this final direction without saving all of the values along the way. Here we iterate 1000 steps and save the final value. This limiting vector, whose entries are scaled to sum to one, is called Gould’s Index.

Look at the table and observe that: LAX, DEN and SEA have the same degree centrality. However LAX and DEN have higher Gould Index than SEA. SFO has lower degree centrality than SEA, but higher Gould centrality! So these two centralities give different rankings. Remind yourselves about the intuitive idea behind Gould’s Index. What does Gould Index measure? Why does the Gould Index value SFO more than SEA? Find another pair of cities where the rankings of degree centrality and Gould’s Index differ. Look at the plot of the network and explain why this is the case. 20.3.6 Gould Index Summary Now that we understand what Gould’s Index means, let’s summarize how to find the Gould Index values for an adjacency matrix \\(A\\). Create the matrix \\(B = A+I\\). Find the dominant eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) of \\(B\\). Normalize the values of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) so that the entries sum to 1. 20.4 Your Turn: The Rise of Moscow Russian historians often attribute the dominance and rise to power of Moscow to its strategic position on medieval trade routes (see Figure 1). Others argue that sociological and political factors aided Moscow’s rise to power, and thus Moscow did not rise to power strictly because of its strategic location on the trade routes. The figure below shows the major cities and trade routes of medieval Russia. Let’s use Gould’s Index to form a geographer’s opinion about this debate. Either: Moscow’s location was the primary reason for its rise to power, or Other forces must have come into play. Here is the adjacency matrix for this transportation network into an adjacency matrix and a plot of the network.

They wrote: Republicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines – and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive – than at any point in the last two decades. These trends manifest themselves in myriad ways, both in politics and in everyday life. Is this really true, or is this just hype? Let’s see what linear algebra can tell us about the evolution of voting patterns in the US Senate from 1964 to 2012. 21.1 The Data We will analyze datasets corresponding to US Senate votes during a 2-year Congressional Session. Our data sets are 12 years apart, and were chosen to coincide with US election years. Table 21.1: Congressional Sessions of the US Senate Session Years US Election # Floor Votes 84 1963-1965 Lyndon Johnson vs Richard Nixon 534 94 1975-1977 Jimmy Carter vs Gerald Ford 1311 100 1987-1989 George H.

The original data can be found at voteview.com. There are two files for each year. A csv file containing a matrix whose \\((i,j)\\) entry counts the number of times Senator \\(i\\) and Senator \\(j\\) cast the same vote on an issue. There are actually nine different possibilities, including Yea, Nay, Present, Abstention and “Not a member of the chamber when the vote was taken.” A csv file containing senator information: name, state and party affiliation. senate.1964.files = c(&#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20/main/data/Senate088matrix.csv&#39;, &#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20//main/data/Senate088senators.csv&#39;) senate.1976.files = c(&#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20/main/data/Senate094matrix.csv&#39;, &#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20//main/data/Senate094senators.csv&#39;) senate.1988.files = c(&#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20/main/data/Senate100matrix.csv&#39;, &#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20//main/data/Senate100senators.csv&#39;) senate.2000.files = c(&#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20/main/data/Senate106matrix.csv&#39;, &#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20//main/data/Senate106senators.csv&#39;) senate.2012.files = c(&#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20/main/data/Senate112matrix.csv&#39;, &#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20//main/data/Senate112senators.csv&#39;) 21.2 The 88th Congressional Session (1964) Let’s load in our data. # pick the data set that we want to look at senate.files = senate.1964.files # First we load in the information about the senators. # We will use these names as our labels. # We also set up the colors we will use for our data points. senators &lt;- read.csv(senate.files[2], header=FALSE) sen.name = senators[,2] sen.party = senators[,4] sen.color=rep(&quot;chartreuse&quot;, length(senators)) sen.color[sen.party==&#39;D&#39;]=&quot;cornflowerblue&quot; sen.color[sen.party==&#39;R&#39;]=&quot;firebrick&quot; # Next we load in the square matrix that measures how often senators voted together. # We add names for the columns and rows. votes &lt;- read.csv(senate.files[1], header=FALSE) names(votes) &lt;- sen.name row.names(votes) &lt;- sen.name knitr::kable( head(votes), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;Congressional Sessions of the US Senate&#39; ) Table 21.2: Congressional Sessions of the US Senate AIKEN George David ALLOTT Gordon Llewellyn ANDERSON Clinton Presba BARTLETT Edward Lewis (Bob) BEALL James Glenn BENNETT Wallace Foster BIBLE Alan Harvey BOGGS James Caleb BREWSTER Daniel Baugh BURDICK Quentin Northrup BYRD Harry Flood BYRD Robert Carlyle CANNON Howard Walter CARLSON Frank CASE Clifford Philip CHURCH Frank Forrester CLARK Joseph Sill COOPER John Sherman COTTON Norris H.

Aiken voted with Anderson 252 times. Allot voted with Anderson 221 times. And so on. We also should note that ** each “coordinate” represents a senator. Coordinate 1 is “Aiken.” Coordinate 2 is “Allot,” etc. This interpretation will be important later! 21.3 Using the Eigenbasis As the table above notes, there are 102 Senators in our data set. So each Senator is represented by a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{102}\\). This vector represents how similar the Senator is to each colleague. But just because our data lives in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{102}\\) doesn’t mean that it is inherently 102-dimensional! We can draw a line in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). That line is 1-dimensional, even though it lives in a higher dimensional space. Maybe if we find a good basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{102}\\) then we can detect some interesting features of the data set. So what happens if we use an eigenbasis? We know that this basis is custom-made for our matrix. Here is what we will observe: The basis of eigenvector of our matrix will pick up some patterns in our data. The eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are the most important ones when modeling our column space. This is where the patterns are! The eigenvectors for the small eigenvalues don’t really matter. They just pick up “noise” in the data. In other words: Our data set will be “essentially low dimensional” (maybe only 3D or 4D) even though it lives in a high dimensional space. Moreover, the structure of the eigenvectors (for the large eigenvalues) will reflect the prevalent patterns in the data. 21.3.1 Using the Dominant Eigenvectors. First we will find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. mat = data.matrix(votes) eigsys = eigen(mat) eigsys$values ## [1] 24198.14970 4385.33792 2523.42898 413.59778 274.12291 219.84394 93.86570 -19.59596 -39.68442 -73.58725 ## [11] -84.08451 -124.18257 -137.88542 -155.95645 -162.94701 -176.71449 -183.14311 -197.74427 -203.16191 -219.90337 ## [21] -222.98559 -225.77864 -236.01870 -240.90787 -249.06305 -257.49697 -263.81555 -268.10860 -272.63265 -275.30214 ## [31] -279.92416 -280.34948 -287.69592 -292.00408 -296.93484 -299.17667 -303.67128 -309.89778 -314.33373 -318.90633 ## [41] -320.25895 -321.98658 -326.58688 -327.83596 -332.06144 -336.46538 -338.76991 -343.48455 -346.38591 -348.16746 ## [51] -349.23190 -350.47588 -358.25692 -359.24338 -360.90037 -363.21807 -365.17417 -370.46006 -371.56674 -374.12517 ## [61] -379.23090 -380.38760 -382.65978 -384.71680 -388.62093 -389.78271 -391.81075 -394.10770 -396.11524 -400.65534 ## [71] -401.80357 -405.81092 -407.44165 -410.46333 -411.66607 -412.99086 -416.39535 -418.09114 -418.76583 -422.02379 ## [81] -424.59269 -426.38701 -428.84359 -430.30353 -431.59921 -435.24536 -435.91447 -437.63064 -439.58808 -443.56104 ## [91] -445.20242 -447.99489 -451.15747 -453.68351 -454.57543 -458.33775 -461.38347 -463.97462 -467.11710 -469.27240 ## [101] -474.43223 -475.75931 What do we see? The largest eigenvalue \\(\\approx 24200\\) is huge compared to the others! There is a huge gap after that. So this eigenspace is the most important (by far)! The second and third eigenvectors are still pretty big \\(\\approx 4400\\) and \\(\\approx 2500\\). But then we have another big gap: the rest have magnitudes below 500. So it seems like this data set is “roughly” 3-dimensional. Of course, this isn’t technically correct because our matrix is invertible (all the eigenvalues are nonzero). But you can think of this data set as a “cloud of points” around a 3D subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{102}\\). 21.3.2 Patterns in the First Two Eigenvectors Let’s create a plot of the first two eigenvectors. Each point represents a Senator. # let&#39;s give simple names to our top eigenvectors v1 = eigsys$vectors[,1] v2 = eigsys$vectors[,2] v3 = eigsys$vectors[,3] v4 = eigsys$vectors[,4] v5 = eigsys$vectors[,5] # Plot use v1 for the x-axis and v2 for the y-axis # We color the points by the party of the Senator xdir = v1 ydir = v2 plot(xdir, ydir, col=sen.color) During class, we will talk about how to think about this picture. We will also compare this plot to plots made using the other eigenvectors. 21.3.3 Creating a Table Sorted by an Eigenvector When we get to more contemporary data, it will be fun later on to look at the names of the Senators who get large (positive or negative) eigenvector scores.

Democrats and Republicans are finding plenty of common ground. When we look at the “extremes” we find some recognizable names, including Hubert Humphrey (D) and Barry Goldwater (R). But there is no clear “left” or “right” pattern to the party affiliation. What about the remaining 5 data sets? It’s your turn to explore and discuss. The code above has been written for ease of reuse.

Find the eigenvalues. Where are the gaps? What is the rough “dimension” of each data set? Plotting the two dominant eigenvectors. Do you see evidence of political divission? Then try plotting other pairs of eigenvectors. Which ones are just noise? Create tables of the two extreme for the dominant eigenvectors. Do you see any names that you recognize? Finally, you have some evidence to help you to answer the orignal question: “Is US Politics more polarized than ever before?” "],["modeling-of-ecological-systems.html", "Vector 22 Modeling of Ecological Systems 22.1 Helper Functions to Plot Dynamical Systems 22.2 Northern Spotted Owl Population 22.3 Northern Spotted Owls Revisited 22.4 Brook Trout in Hunt Creek, MI", " Vector 22 Modeling of Ecological Systems Download this Rmd file In this exploration, we will explore the dynamics of a female animal population modeled by a Leslie matrix \\(L\\) which has the form \\[L = \\begin{bmatrix} F_1 &amp; F_2 &amp; F_3 &amp; \\cdots &amp; F_{n-1} &amp; F_n \\\\ S_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0&amp; S_2 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0&amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; S_{n-2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0&amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; S_{n-1} &amp; S_n \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] The female population is grouped in \\(n\\) age classes.

When my phone suggests that it’s time for bed, or volunteers how long my today’s commute will be, I am benefiting from machine learning. My phone has learned my patterns and is predicting what might be useful for me today based on past data. Rather than being “told” the answer up front, a machine learning algorithm learns what to do by analyzing training data. The algorithm then uses patterns to decide what to do with new data. In other words, these algorithms learn from experience, just like humans do. That’s why machine learning falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. And guess what sits at the heart of machine learning? That’s right: linear algebra. Today we will create a rudimentary machine learning algorithm using the dot product in a high-dimensional space. 23.1 US Post Office Zip Code Data We will look at a classic machine learning problem: identifying hand-written digits. Our data comes from the U.S. Postal Service: each digit comes zip codes automatically scanned from envelopes. I found this data at this Machine Learning course page at Stanford, but it originates from the neural network group at AT&amp;T research labs. I’ve made a copy of the data, and pre-processed the training data (to speed things up for us). Let’s load the data and print out the first 10 rows and columns of the test data. library(readr) require(pracma) digit.test.file = &#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20//main/data/digit-test.csv&#39; digit.centroids.file = &#39;https://raw.github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20//main/data/digit-centroid.csv&#39; test &lt;- data.matrix(read_csv(digit.test.file, col_names = FALSE)) centroids &lt;- data.matrix(read_csv(digit.centroids.file, col_names = FALSE)) # take the transpose so that we can deal with column vectors (which is what we are used to) test=t(test) centroids=t(centroids) dim(test) ## [1] 257 2007 test[1:10,1:10] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## X1 9.000 6 3.000 6 6.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 6.000 9.000 ## X2 -1.000 -1 -1.000 -1 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 ## X3 -1.000 -1 -1.000 -1 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 ## X4 -1.000 -1 -1.000 -1 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 ## X5 -1.000 -1 -0.593 -1 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 ## X6 -1.000 -1 0.700 -1 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000 ## X7 -0.948 -1 1.000 -1 -1.000 -1.000 -0.785 -0.914 -1.000 -0.904 ## X8 -0.561 -1 1.000 -1 -1.000 0.195 0.775 -0.688 -1.000 -0.060 ## X9 0.148 -1 1.000 -1 -0.858 1.000 0.268 -0.736 -0.761 0.638 ## X10 0.384 -1 1.000 -1 -0.106 0.054 -1.000 0.956 0.438 0.678 The data set has 257 rows and 2007 columns. Each column of the data corresponds to a hand-written digit. So the test data has 2007 hand-written digits. 23.1.1 Visualizing the Data Here is how the data is formatted. The first value in each column tells you the correct digit. Looking at the data above, we see that the first ten hand-written digits are \\(9,6,3,6,6,0,0,0,6,9\\). The remaining 256 values in each column correspond to a grayscale image of the digit. We must reshape this \\(256 \\times 1\\) column vector into a \\(16 \\times 16\\) matrix in order to display it. The following code will display the handwritten image for a given column. (Note: You don’t have to understand this code.) # Takes in a vector of length 257 and creates an image form entries 2:257 # digitcol: a 257 x 1 vector. The first entry is the digit classification. The remaining 256 entries are the 16 x 16 image. plot_digit &lt;- function(digitcol) { img = digitcol[2:257] dim(img) &lt;- c(16, 16) img = img[,ncol(img):1 ] image(img, axes = FALSE, col = grey(seq(0, 1, length = 256))) } Now let’s display a few random digits from the test dataset. Feel free to re-run this block a few times. You’ll see different examples each time! samp = sample(1:dim(test)[2], 6, replace=FALSE) for (i in 1:6) { print(test[1,samp[i]]) plot_digit(test[,samp[i]]) } ## X1 ## 8 ## X1 ## 5 ## X1 ## 0 ## X1 ## 8 ## X1 ## 2 ## X1 ## 3 Next, let’s talk about our training data. The original training data has 7291 different digits. Different machine learning techniques will use this data in different ways. But each of them follows the same idea: Define a measure of “closenesss” to the training data of known digits. Then compare the new (unknown) digits and categorize it according to the best fit to the training data. Our goal today is to highlight the role of linear algebra, not come up with a high-performance algorithm. So we will simplify our training set. I have pre-processed the 7291 training digits and found the “average” vector for each digit. We will refer to these 10 training vectors as centroids since we are finding the vector in the center of all the training digits of each type. Since these are averages, when we plot them, they will look like blurry versions of the actual digit. Let’s look. library(grid) images = vector() for (i in 0:9) { dimg = centroids[,i+1] plot_digit(dimg) } 23.1.2 Algorithm Overview Here is our simple machine learning algorithm. For each test digit: Find the centroid that is closest to that digit. Classify the test digit as the same type as that centroid. We will consider two definitions of “closeness.” Both are calculated using the dot product! The distance between the vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{256}\\). This Euclidean distance or Pythagorean distance is probably what you were thinking of when I started talking about distance in high dimensions. The angle between the vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{256}\\). Interesting! Does this surprise you? Why is this a reasonable way to measure distance? Well, span is one of the two fundamental characteristics of linear algebra (the other is linear independence). By measuring the angle between the vectors, we have a notion of distance between the span of each vector. In other words, the angle measures the distance between a pair of one-dimensional subspaces. This measure is known as cosine similarity. So let’s get started. Here is the good news: I’ve written the code to process all 2007 of the digits and then compare the classification to the truth. The results are then presented a matrix whose \\((i,j)\\)-th entry counts the number of time digit \\(i\\) was classified as digit \\(j\\). (So we hope that the diagonal entries will be big!) Here’s the even better news: I’ve left three functions for you to implement using the dot product. 23.2 Length, Distance and Angle Here are the three methods that you must implement: get_length(colvec) get_distance(colvec1, colvec2) get_angle(colvec1, colvec2) Implement these methods according to the definitions: \\[ \\| \\mathsf{v} \\| = \\sqrt{ \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v}}, \\qquad d(\\mathsf{v}, \\mathsf{w}) = \\| \\mathsf{v} - \\mathsf{w} \\|, \\qquad \\theta = \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{w}}{\\| \\mathsf{v} \\| \\, \\| \\mathsf{w} \\|} \\right). \\] Here are some R functions that you will need. The dot product of two column vectors colvec1 and colvec2 is calculated by t(colvec1) %*% colvec2. Here we are tranposing colvec1 to turn it into a row vector.

You will find that each of them does okay (but not great) for this data set. Both get around \\(80\\%\\) of the digits correct. (A good machine learning algorithm can get \\(98\\%\\) correct.) Run the code below and look at the output. Discuss the following questions Which digits are most commonly mistaken for one another? Which algorithm does better: closest by distance or closest by angle? We turned the training data into a single centroid and then used that to measure distances. A better algorithm would make use of all of the training points during the classification. Discuss what improvements you would try instead of using the centroids. 23.3.1 Get Closest by Distance # Finds closest centroid to the given data # data - a column vector of length 257. the first entry is the actual digit. the remaining 256 are the data # centroids - a 257 x 10 matrix.

The Why: Given a matrix \\(A\\) and a vector \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) that is not in \\(W = \\mathrm{Col}(A)\\), we want to find the “best approximate solution” \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{b}} \\in W\\). In other words, we want to pick the best possible \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{b}} \\approx \\mathsf{b}\\) that is in the column space of \\(A\\). The What: The answer is to use projections. * This “best approximation” is the projection \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{b}} = \\mbox{proj}_W \\mathsf{b}\\). * The residual vector vector \\(\\mathsf{z} = \\mathsf{b} - \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is in \\(W^{\\perp}\\). * The length \\(\\| \\mathsf{z} \\|\\) of the residual vector measures the closeness the approximation. * The approximate soltuion to our original problem is the vector \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}\\) such that \\(A \\hat{\\mathsf{x}} = \\hat{\\mathsf{b}}\\). The How: A clever way to solve this is to use the normal equations. The best choice for \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}\\) satisfies \\[ A^{\\top} A \\hat{\\mathsf{x}} = A^{\\top} \\mathsf{b}. \\] Here is a template for the R code that will find the least squares solution \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}\\), the projection vector \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{b}} = \\mbox{proj}_W \\mathsf{b}\\) and the residual vector \\(\\mathsf{z} = \\mathsf{b} - \\hat{\\mathsf{b}}\\). You should read this code line-by-line and make sure that you understand what it is doing! # Given: the matrix A # Given: the target vector b #solve the normal equation (xhat = solve(t(A) %*% A, t(A) %*% b)) # find the projection (bhat = A %*% xhat) # find the residual vector (z = b - bhat) # check that z is orthogonal to Col(A) t(A) %*% z # measure the distance between bhat and b sqrt( t(z) %*% z) 24.2 Fitting for a Linear Function Here are some points that we’d like to fit a line to. Note: Here we use y instead of b because we like to write linear equations as “\\(y = cx + d\\).” So the expression “\\(b = cx +d\\)” looks funny to us. So we will talk about y and yhat instead of b and bhat. x = c(1, 2, 3, 4) y = c(1, 2.4, 3.6, 4) plot(x,y,pch=19,ylim=c(0,5),) grid() To fit a line \\(y = d + cx\\) to the data, we need to solve the following \\(Ax = b\\) problem: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} d \\\\ c \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2.4 \\\\ 3.6 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\] These equations are inconsistent, so we solve the normal equations \\(A^T A x = A^T y\\) instead. A clever way to create the desired matrix \\(A\\) is to use the fact that \\(x^0=1\\) for any number \\(x\\). (A = cbind(x^0,x)) ## x ## [1,] 1 1 ## [2,] 1 2 ## [3,] 1 3 ## [4,] 1 4 24.2.1 Your Turn Use the template code above to find xhat. This is the “least squares solution” that approximates the coefficients \\(c, d\\). # Replace with your code goes here. xhat = c(0,0) 24.2.2 Plotting your least squares solution The following code gives you a visualization of the approximate solution. * The black points: the original data points cbind(x,y). This represents the entries of the desired target vector y. * The blue curve: the fitted curve, created from the approximate solution xhat. * The orange points: the approximations cbind(x,yhat) of the data points cbind(x,y). This represents entries of the projection yhat. * The red line segments: the distances between the original data points (block dots) and their approximations (orange dots). The lengths of these red segments are the entries of the residual vector z plot(x,y,pch=19,ylim=c(0,5), main=&#39;the best-fit linear function&#39;) (yhat = A %*% xhat) ## [,1] ## [1,] 0 ## [2,] 0 ## [3,] 0 ## [4,] 0 tt = seq(1,4,len=100) lines(tt,xhat[1]+xhat[2]*tt,col=&#39;blue&#39;) for (i in 1:length(x)) { lines(c(x[i],x[i]),c(y[i],yhat[i]), col=&#39;red&#39;) } points(x,yhat,pch=19,col=&#39;orange&#39;) points(x,y,pch=19,col=&quot;black&quot;) 24.2.3 Your turn If you have not already done so Find the residual vector \\(z\\). Find the length of \\(z\\). This is a measure of the quality of the approximation: the smaller, the better! Confirm that \\(z\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\mbox{Col}(A)\\). (You may want to use zapsmall().) # your code goes here 24.3 Fitting a Quadratic Function It might surprise you at first that we can use linear algebra to fit a quadratic function. But remember: we are fitting the coefficients. One we plug in our experimental data, we have a linear combination of the unknown coefficients! So let’s fit a quadratic function \\(y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2\\) to the following data: x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6) y = c(7,2,1,3,7,7) plot(x,y,pch=19,ylim=c(0,10)) grid() In this case, the linear model that we’d like to solve is: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 \\\\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 9 \\\\ 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 16 \\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 25 \\\\ 1 &amp; 6 &amp; 36 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a_0 \\\\ a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 7 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Again, this is inconsistent (go ahead and check if you want to). So we need to find the best approximate solution. I will make the \\(A\\) matrix for you one more time. (You’ll have to construct it in the examples below.) A = cbind(x^0, x, x^2) 24.3.1 Your Turn Use the template code above to find xhat. This is the “least squares solution” that approximations of the coefficients \\(a_0, a_1, a_2\\). # Replace with your code goes here. xhat = c(0,0,0) 24.3.2 Plotting your least squares solution Note: this code assumes that you have defined xhat (yhat = A %*% xhat) ## [,1] ## [1,] 0 ## [2,] 0 ## [3,] 0 ## [4,] 0 ## [5,] 0 ## [6,] 0 # plotting the solution plot(x,y,pch=19,ylim=c(0,10), main=&#39;the best-fit quadratic function&#39;) tt = seq(0,7,len=100) lines(tt,xhat[1] + xhat[2]*tt + xhat[3]*tt^2,col=&#39;blue&#39;) grid() # adding the residual lines for (i in 1:length(x)) { lines(c(x[i],x[i]),c(y[i],yhat[i]), col=&#39;red&#39;) } points(x,yhat,pch=19,col=&#39;orange&#39;) points(x,y,pch=19,col=&quot;black&quot;) 24.3.3 Your turn If you have not already done so Find the residual vector \\(z\\). Compare the entries (positive, negative) with the red line segments in the plot above. Find the length of \\(z\\). This is a measure of the quality of the approximation: the smaller, the better! Confirm that \\(z\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\mbox{Col}(A)\\). (You may want to use zapsmall().) # your code goes here 24.4 A Linear Model for Production at a Hosiery Mill Here is a data set from a 1940’s hosiery mill. It measures monthly production output and total production cost. The data come from the article “Statistical Cost Functions of a Hosiery Mill”, by Joel Dean in Studies in Business Administration, vol. 14, no. 3, 1941. units.produced =c(561.0, 506.16, 502.32, 519.48, 505.44, 501.36, 497.64, 506.52, 492.36, 478.08, 469.8, 470.4, 474.24, 456.6, 469.92, 463.08, 438.48, 444.36, 439.2, 450.96, 437.76, 459., 447.12, 463.08, 490.68, 451.92, 465.48, 465.36, 440.4, 421.2, 405., 411.48, 387.12, 371.64, 338.4, 294.96, 243., 205.08, 172.2, 157.32, 114., 116.88, 112.08, 90.12, 100.2, 75., 65.4, 45.48) production.cost = c(92.64, 88.81, 86.44, 88.8, 86.38, 89.87, 88.53, 91.11, 81.22, 83.72, 84.54, 85.66, 85.87, 85.23, 87.75, 92.62, 91.56, 84.12, 81.22, 83.35, 82.29, 80.92, 76.92, 78.35, 74.57, 71.6, 65.64, 62.09, 61.66, 77.14, 75.47, 70.37, 66.71, 64.37, 56.09, 50.25, 43.65, 38.01, 31.4, 29.45, 29.02, 19.05, 20.36, 17.68, 19.23, 14.92, 11.44, 12.69) Fit a linear model between the units produced and the production cost. \\[p=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 u,\\] where \\(u\\) is the number of units produced in a given month (in thousands), \\(p\\) is the monthly production cost (in $1000s). The constant \\(\\beta_0\\) represents the fixed costs for running the hosiery mill and \\(\\beta_1\\) represents the variable cost per production of 1000 units. Use least squares approximation to find the best fitting linear function for this data. Look at the previous two examples for how to create your matrix \\(A\\). Look at your least squared solution. What are the monthly fixed costs? What are the variable costs per 1000 units? Plot the data along with your linear function. Optional: Compute the length of the residual vector Optional: Confirm that the residual vector is orthogonal to both columns of the coefficient matrix. # your least squares code goes here x = units.produced y = production.cost # you must define A and xhat **Note: this code assumes that you have defined xhat and ’xandyandA` Remove the leading tick mark in the line below make the block executable. ’{r sqhosiery,fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5, echo=TRUE} plot(x,y,pch=19, main='hosiery mill production', xlab=\"monthly units produced (1000s)\",ylab=\"monthly production cost ($1000s)\") yhat = A %*% xhat tt = seq(0,600,by=.1) lines(tt,xhat[1]+xhat[2]*tt,col='blue') 24.5 Global Fossil Fuel Emissions Now let’s fit a curve to global fossil fuel emmissions between 1751 and 1998. The fossil fuel emissions are measured in megatons of carbon. Here is a plot of the data. year=c(1751:1998) emissions = c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18, 18, 18, 24, 23, 23, 24, 24, 25, 29, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 43, 43, 46, 47, 50, 54, 54, 57, 59, 69, 71, 76, 77, 78, 83, 91, 95, 97, 104, 112, 119, 122, 130, 135, 142, 147, 156, 173, 184, 174, 188, 191, 194, 196, 210, 236, 243, 256, 272, 275, 277, 281, 295, 327, 327, 356, 372, 374, 370, 383, 406, 419, 440, 465, 507, 534, 552, 566, 617, 624, 663, 707, 784, 750, 785, 819, 836, 879, 943, 850, 838, 901, 955, 936, 806, 932, 803, 845, 970, 963, 975, 983, 1062, 1065, 1145, 1053, 940, 847, 893, 973, 1027, 1130, 1209, 1142, 1192, 1299, 1334, 1342, 1391, 1383, 1160, 1238, 1392, 1469, 1419, 1630, 1767, 1795, 1841, 1865, 2043, 2177, 2270, 2330, 2463, 2578, 2595, 2701, 2848, 3009, 3146, 3306, 3412, 3588, 3802, 4075, 4227, 4394, 4633, 4641, 4613, 4879, 5018, 5078, 5368, 5297, 5125, 5080, 5067, 5241, 5405, 5573, 5701, 5926, 6035, 6096, 6186, 6089, 6090, 6236, 6378, 6530, 6628, 6608) plot(year,emissions,pch=20,cex=.7,col=&quot;red&quot;) The data suggest that the fossil fuel emissions (\\(f\\)) follow an exponential model with respect to the year (\\(y\\)): \\[f = c e^{k(y-1750)},\\] where \\(c\\) and \\(k\\) are the unknown constants (parameters of the model). How do we fit a linear model in this case? Just take the logarithm of both sides! Doing so yields the following linear system: \\[\\log(f)=\\log(c)+k(y-1750).\\] Note: This process works for any logarithm, but it is common to use the natural logarithm (use log() in R). Note: To simplify even further, define time=year-1750 before forming your set of linear constraints. This results in the model \\[ \\log(f)=d+kx,\\] where \\(b=\\log(a)\\) and \\(x\\) is time (since 1750), Use least squares approximation to find the best fitting exponential function for this data. This will give you the values for \\(d\\) and \\(k\\), and once you know \\(d\\), you can find \\(c = exp(d)\\).

Since \\(T\\) is not one-to-one, the mapping cannot be onto. True Since \\(U\\) and \\(W\\) are subspaces, we know that \\(\\mathbb{0} \\in U\\) and \\(\\mathbb{0} \\in W\\). Therefore \\(\\mathbb{0} \\in U \\cap W\\). Let \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 \\in U \\cap W\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_2 \\in U \\cap W\\). + We know that \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 \\in U\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_2 \\in U\\). Since \\(U\\) is a subspace, we have \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 \\in U\\). + We know that \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 \\in W\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_2 \\in W\\). Since \\(W\\) is a subspace, we have \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 \\in W\\). Therefore \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 \\in U \\cap W\\). Let \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in U \\cap W\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). We know that \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in U\\) and \\(c \\in R\\). Since \\(U\\) is a subspace, we have \\(c \\mathsf{v} \\in U\\). We know that \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in W\\) and \\(c \\in R\\). Since \\(W\\) is a subspace, we have \\(c \\mathsf{v} \\in W\\). Therefore \\(c \\mathsf{v} \\in U \\cap W\\). False. Here is an example that shows this is not always true. Let \\(V= \\mathbb{R}^2\\), \\(U = \\{ { x \\choose 0} \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}\\) and \\(W= \\{ { 0 \\choose y} \\mid y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}\\). The set \\(U \\cup W\\) is not closed under addition. For example, \\({1 \\choose 0} + {0 \\choose 1} = { 1 \\choose 1} \\notin U \\cup W\\). True. Since \\(U\\) and \\(W\\) are subspaces, we know that \\(\\mathbb{0} \\in U\\) and \\(\\mathbb{0} \\in W\\). Therefore \\(\\mathbb{0} = \\mathbb{0} + \\mathbb{0} \\in U + W\\). Let \\(\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_1 \\in U + W\\) and \\(\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_2 \\in U + W\\), where \\(\\mathsf{u}_1, \\mathsf{u}_2 \\in U\\) and \\(\\mathsf{w}_1, \\mathsf{w}_2 \\in W\\). Then \\[ (\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_1) + (\\mathsf{u}_2 + \\mathsf{w}_2) = (\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{u}_2) + (\\mathsf{w}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_2) \\] and \\(\\mathsf{u}_3 = (\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{u}_2) \\in U\\) (because \\(U\\) is a subspace) and \\(\\mathsf{w}_3 = (\\mathsf{w}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_2) \\in W\\) (because \\(W\\) is a subspace). Therefore \\((\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_1) + (\\mathsf{u}_2 + \\mathsf{w}_2) = \\mathsf{u}_3 + \\mathsf{w}_3 \\in U + W\\). Let \\(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{w} \\in U + W\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Then \\(c(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{w}) = c \\mathsf{u} + c \\mathsf{w}\\). We know that \\(c \\mathsf{u} \\in U\\) (since \\(U\\) is a subspace) and \\(c \\mathsf{w} \\in W\\) (since \\(W\\) is a subspace). Therefore \\(c(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{w}) = c \\mathsf{u} + c \\mathsf{w} \\in U+W\\). Suppose that \\(c_1 T(\\mathsf{v}_1) + c_2 T(\\mathsf{v}_2) + c_3 T(\\mathsf{v}_3) = 0\\). We must show that \\(c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0\\). Since \\(T\\) is a linear transformation, this means that \\(T(c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1+ c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + c_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 )= 0\\). Since \\(T\\) is one-to-one and \\(T(\\mathbf{0}) = \\mathbf{0}\\), we must have \\(c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1+ c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + c_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 = \\mathbf{0}\\). Because \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3\\) are linearly independent, this means that \\(c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0\\). This proves that \\(T(\\mathsf{v}_1), T(\\mathsf{v}_2), T(\\mathsf{v}_3)\\) are linearly independent. Given \\(\\mathsf{w} \\in W\\). We must show that there exist constants \\(c_1, c_2, c_3\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{w} = c_1 T(\\mathsf{v}_1) + c_2 T(\\mathsf{v}_2) + c_3 T(\\mathsf{v}_3)\\). Here we go! Since \\(T\\) is onto, we know that there exists \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(T(\\mathsf{v}) = \\mathsf{w}\\). Since \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3\\) span \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), we know that there exist constants \\(c_1, c_2, c_3\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{v}= c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + c_3 \\mathsf{v}_k\\) Therefore \\[ \\mathsf{w} = T(\\mathsf{v})= T(c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + c_3 \\mathsf{v}_k) = c_1 T(\\mathsf{v}_1) + c_2 T(\\mathsf{v}_2) + c_3 T(\\mathsf{v}_k) \\] because \\(T\\) is a linear transformation. This proves that \\(T(\\mathsf{v}_1), T(\\mathsf{v}_2), T(\\mathsf{v}_3)\\) span \\(W\\).

If today is a dry day, then the probability that tomorrow is wet is 0.250 and the probability that tomorrow is dry will be 0.75.

Describe what happens to these populations over time, and relate these observations to the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the transition matrix. The second option they consider is a limited wolf hunting season. This reduces the productivity of the wolves, giving the new model: \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{r} X_{t+1} \\\\ Y_{t+1} \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{rr} 0.6 &amp; 0.4 \\\\ -0.2 &amp; 1.2 \\end{array} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{array}{r} X_{t} \\\\ Y_{t} \\end{array} \\right] \\] whose transition matrix has eigenvectors and eigenvalues \\[ \\lambda_1 = 1 \\mbox{ with eigenvector } \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\lambda_2 = 0.8 \\mbox{ with eigenvector } \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0.5 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Once again, draw or desctibe the trajectory of the populations starting at \\((X_0, Y_0) = (1,2)\\) in the above vector plot. Describe what happens to these populations over time, and relate these observations to the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the transition matrix. The conservation biologists want to create a stable ecosystem, where the populations of deer and wolves remain constant over time. Which option (deer breeding or limited wolf hunting) would you recommend? A population of female bison is split into three groups: juveniles who are less than one year old; yearlings between one and two years old; and adults who are older than two years. Each year, 80% of the juveniles survive to become yearlings. 90% of the yearlings survive to become adults. 80% of the adults survive. 40% of the adults give birth to a juvenile Let \\(\\mathsf{x}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} J_t \\\\ Y_t \\\\ A_t \\end{bmatrix}\\) be the state of the system in year \\(t\\). Find the Leslie matrix \\(L\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{x}_{t+1} = B \\mathsf{x}_t.\\). Find the eigenvalues of \\(L\\). The matrix \\(L\\) has two complex eigenvalues and one real eigenvalue. How do the complex eigenvectors manifest in the trajectory of a population? What is the long-term behavior of the herd? Will the size of the herd grow, stablilize or shrink? What will be the proportions of juveniles, yearlings and adults in the herd? 27.3 Solutions to Practice Problems There are three eigenvalues: 1, 2, and \\(-2\\). We find an eigenvector for each of them. Eigenvalue \\(\\lambda = 1\\) \\[ A - I = \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ -2 &amp; 5 &amp; -3 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; -3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] So one eigenvector is \\([1,1,1]^{\\top}\\) Eigenvalue \\(\\lambda = 2\\) \\[ A - 2I = \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\\\ -2 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} -2 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\\\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} -2 &amp; 0 &amp; -4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] So one eigenvector is \\([-2,0,1]^{\\top}\\) Eigenvalue \\(\\lambda = -2\\) \\[ A - 2I = \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\\\ -2 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ -2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\sim \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] So one eigenvector is \\([0,0,1]^{\\top}\\) \\(\\lambda=0\\) is one eigenvalue. We know that the other eigenvalue is nonzero, since we are mapping onto a line. However, we can’t say anything more without additional information. The eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2=-1\\). Let \\(L\\) be the line of reflection. If \\(\\mathsf{v} = [a,b]^{\\top}\\) is on \\(L\\), then \\(T(\\mathsf{v}) = \\mathsf{v}\\). The vector \\(\\mathsf{w} = [-b,a]^{\\top}\\) is perpendicular to \\(L\\), so \\(T(\\mathsf{w}) = -\\mathsf{w}\\). The eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2=-1\\) because \\[ T\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} -x_1 \\\\ -x_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] There is one eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=1\\) with algebraic multiplicity 2. However, it only has geometric multiplicity 1. We know that a shear matrix is not diagonalizable. \\(A\\) is not invertible because \\(0\\) is an eigenvalue. \\(A\\) is diagonalizable because it have 5 distinct eigenvalues. \\(B\\) is invertible because \\(0\\) is not an eigenvalue. \\(B\\) is diagonalizable because it have 5 distinct eigenvalues. \\(C\\) is invertible because \\(0\\) is not an eigenvalue. We cannot tell whether \\(C\\) is diagonalizable without more information. The eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=2\\) has algebraic multiplicity 2. We need to know whether the geometric multiplicity is 1 or 2. \\(D\\) is not invertible because \\(0\\) is an eigenvalue. We cannot tell whether \\(D\\) is diagonalizable without more information. The eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=3\\) has algebraic multiplicity 2. We need to know whether the geometric multiplicity is 1 or 2. No, \\(A\\) is not invertible because \\(0\\) is an eigenvalue. \\(\\mathsf{v} = [1, -2, 1]^{\\top}\\) is an eigenvector for \\(\\lambda=0\\). Therefore \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in \\mbox{Nul}(A)\\). The vector \\(\\mathsf{v} = [0,1,2]^{\\top}\\) is an eigenvector for \\(\\lambda=1\\). So this is a steady-state vector. (However, the dynamical system will not converge to this steady state because \\(\\lambda=6\\) is the dominant eigenvalue.) When \\(A=P D P^{-1}\\), we can find the coordinates of a vector with respect to the eigenbasis via multiplication by \\(P^{-1}\\). Pinv =cbind(c(-1/6,0,1/6),c(-1/15,1/5,-1/3),c(1/30,2/5,1/6)) v = c(1,2,3) Pinv %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] -0.2 ## [2,] 1.6 ## [3,] 0.0 So \\([ \\mathsf{v}]_{\\mathcal{B}} = [-1/5, 8/5, 0]^{\\top}\\). \\(-\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 6^{2020} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} -5 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\frac{8}{5} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\) This system scales by \\(\\sqrt{1+1} = \\sqrt{2}\\) and it rotates by \\(\\tan^{-1} (1/1) = \\pi/4\\). We have \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; -b \\\\ b &amp; a \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} .97 &amp; -.71\\\\ .71 &amp; .97 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Let’s turn to RStudio a = .97 b = .71 scale = sqrt(a^2+b^2) angle = atan (b/a) scale ## [1] 1.202082 angle ## [1] 0.6318544 2 * pi / angle ## [1] 9.94404 It takes 10 iterations to rotate past the \\(x\\)-axis. We are further from the origin because \\(| \\lambda| \\approx 1.2 &gt; 1\\). The matrix \\(A\\) is diagonalizable because it has 3 distinct eigenvalues We must see whether \\(\\lambda=4\\) has geometric multiplicty 2 (to match its algebraic multiplicity). rref( cbind(c(-1,-1,2), c(-1,-1,2), c(2,2,-4))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 -2 ## [2,] 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 0 We see that \\(B - 4I\\) has two free columns, so \\(\\dim ( \\mbox{Nul}(B-4I))=2\\). This means that \\(\\lambda=4\\) has geometric multiplicity 2. Therefore \\(B\\) is diagonalizable. We set \\(P = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 3 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\). So \\[ P^{-1} = - \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; -1 \\\\ -3 &amp; 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.2 &amp; 0.2 \\\\ 0.6 &amp; -0.4 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Or we can find this inverse using RStudio. A = cbind(c(2,3),c(1,-1)) solve(A) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0.2 0.2 ## [2,] 0.6 -0.4 Therefore \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.7 &amp; 0.2 \\\\ 0.3 &amp; 0.8 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 3 &amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0.5 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0.2 &amp; 0.2 \\\\ 0.6 &amp; -0.4 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\(\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A^n = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.4 &amp; 0.6 \\\\ 0.4 &amp; 0.6 \\end{bmatrix}\\) because \\(\\lambda=1\\) is the dominant eigenvalue. So each column of \\(A\\) convergence to vector in the eigenspace for the dominant eigenvalue. Basically, we treat each column of \\(A\\) as a “starting vector” repeated multiplication by \\(A\\) converges to the dominant eigenspace. Here are the details. Let \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}\\). Let’s see why we can treat each column \\(\\mathsf{a}_1, \\mathsf{a}_2\\) of \\(A\\) as a “starting vector.” We can choose to view \\[A^2 = A \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{a}_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} A \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; A \\mathsf{a}_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad A^3 = A \\begin{bmatrix} A \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; A \\mathsf{v}_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} A^{2} \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; A^{2} \\mathsf{v}_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and in general \\[ A^{n} = \\begin{bmatrix} A^{n-1} \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; A^{n-1} \\mathsf{a}_2 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Therefore \\[ \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A^n = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\begin{bmatrix} A^{n-1} \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; A^{n-1} \\mathsf{a}_2 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] So we need to write the columns of \\(A\\) as linear combinations of the eigenvectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2\\). For any constants \\(c_1, c_2\\), we have \\[ \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A^n (c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2) = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left( c_1 A^n \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 A^n \\mathsf{v}_2 \\right) = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left( c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 (0.5)^n \\mathsf{v}_2 \\right) = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1. \\] So we need to find \\(c_1,c_2\\) for each column of \\(A\\). Let’s use R Studio. a1 = c(.7,.3) a2 = c(.2,.8) P = cbind(c(2,3), c(1,-1)) solve(P,a1) ## [1] 0.2 0.3 solve(P,a2) ## [1] 0.2 -0.2 In each case, \\(c_1 = 0.2\\). Therefore \\[ \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A^n = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.4 &amp; 0.4 \\\\ 0.6 &amp; 0.6 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We need to find the coefficients for \\(x_0 = [25, 0]^{\\top}\\). P = cbind(c(2,3), c(1,-1)) v = c(25,0) solve(P,v) ## [1] 5 15 So the formula is \\[ 5 \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix} + 15 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] This converges to \\(5 \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}\\). We have \\[ A = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{1}{2} &amp; \\frac{1}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{5} &amp; \\frac{9}{10} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\begin{bmatrix} -1/2 &amp; 1/2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0.7 &amp; -0.2 \\\\ 0.2 &amp; 0.7 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Here are some R calculations to check the answer for (a) and to find the values for (b) and (c).

Initially, both populations increase from \\([1, 2]\\) to \\([2.25,2.5]\\), with wolves increasing more quickly. The wolves continue to increase, while the deer start to decrease. After reachaing \\([3,2]\\), both populations decrease. The deer die out first at the point \\([.8,0]\\). Deer breeding: Both populations thrive and grow every year, converging slowly to a \\(1:1\\) ratio. The long-term growth rate is \\(1.1\\), or \\(10\\%\\) growth. Wolf hunting: Once again, both populations increase. But this time we converge on a stable population of about \\([2.5, 2.5]\\). Since they want a stable ecosystem, the wolf hunting is a better option. Ww reach a stable equilibrium population of \\([2.5, 2.5]\\) Here is the Leslie matrix, as well as some eigensystem computations.
